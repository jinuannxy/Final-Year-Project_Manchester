We illustrate the approaches for model choice using data from the sales price of pre-owned
VWGolf automobiles. Our goal is to model the relationship between the sales price in 1,000
Euro (variable price) and the five explanatory variables “age of the car in months” (age),
“kilometer reading in 1,000 km” (kilometer), “number of months until the next appointment
with the Technical Inspection Agency” (TIA), “ABS brake yes/no” (extras1), and “sunroof
yes/no” (extras2). Examinations of this kind play an important role in the context of hedonic
price indices. In contrast to common price indices, hedonic price indices take quality
differences of a product into consideration. This is especially of importance when dealing
with product groups that undergo fast technological changes.
